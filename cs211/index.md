# CS211 - Fundamentals of Computer Programming II


## Description

CS 211 teaches foundational software design skills at a small-to-medium scale. We aim to provide a bridge from the student-oriented How to Design Programs languages to real, industry-standard languages and tools. In the first half of the course, you'll learn the basics of imperative programming and manual memory management using the C programming language. In the second half of the course, we'll transition to C++, which provides abstraction mechanisms such as classes and templates that we use to express our design ideas. Topics include expressions, statements, types, functions, branches and iteration, user-defined types, data hiding, basic UNIX shell usage, and testing.


## Prerequisites

 * **CS111 or CS150**: Some college-level programming experience
 * **Note:** Students are strongly advised to take CS150 before CS211. Students with credit for CS150 may take CS111 and CS211 concurrently.


## Textbook

None.


## Detailed Course Topics

 * **C/C++**
    * Introduction to software engineering.
    * Basic data types, variables, computer arithmetic, expressions, parentheses.
    * Basic I/O – cout, cin.
    * Introduction to classes – defining one's own data types
    * Flow of control – sequential, test-and-branch, and iteration. Boolean expressions.
    * Arrays, pointers, and strings.
    * Functions: call by value and call by reference, references vs. pointers, stack frames.
    * Function overloading
 * **Introduction to Classes**
    * Structures and classes, data hiding and encapsulation.
    * Public and private members, constructors, unions.
    * Interface vs. implementation.
    * Class destructors and copy constructors, the = operator, deep versus shallow copies.
    * C++ operator overloading.
    * Heap space, the new/delete operators.
    * Inheritance and derived classes, is-a hierarchies and composition of classes.
    * Virtual functions and polymorphism.
    * Linked list processing: stacks and queues, trees and recursion.
 * **Introduction to UNIX**
    * Processes, file management, redirection and piping, make files.


## Homework

Large programming assignments possibly performed in groups or individually. The goals of the homeworks are to practice language syntax, new programming paradigms, and capabilities of C/C++. Recent homeworks feature:

 * C-style string manipulation
 * Manual memory-management with `malloc()`
 * Real-time and turn-based game design


## Labs

Small programming assignments focused on practicing programming language features. Emphasis is on learning fundamentals.

## Final Project

A larger variation on the homework that allows students to develop a game of
their choosing from scratch. This is spread out over a longer time period as
most homeworks and has various proposal and check-in phases along the way.
